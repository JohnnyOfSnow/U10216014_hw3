The order of homework:

  The homework is based on the textbook p.406~407,
and you have to design a UI interface to let user to 
input data that user only clicks the button BMI and
body status will show on UI interface.

How I design the program:

      JFrame
       /\
      /__\
        |
        |
    BMIcalculator ----- BMI
    
I use six labels to display the item, six textfield to 
let user input data or display the data, one button to let 
user click it that user can get BMI and body status, and two
panel to hold UI component.

How the program run:

1.use the command to compile and execute program
2.A UI interface will show, and you need to input your name,
age, weight, and height.
3.Click the Compute BMI button, and the result will display your
BMI and body status.
